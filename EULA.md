This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (the "User" or "Licensee") and the authors and contributors of GCRecomp (the "Licensor"). By downloading, installing, using, or contributing to GCRecomp, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree, do not use or contribute to the software.

GCRecomp is provided under the CC0-1.0 Universal (Public Domain Dedication) license for its source code, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution of the code itself. However, this EULA governs your use of the software for recompilation purposes and includes additional terms to ensure legal compliance and protect all parties.

## 1. Grant of License
Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, worldwide license to use GCRecomp solely for educational, research, archival, game preservation, and personal non-commercial purposes. This includes:
- Recompiling legally owned GameCube DOL files that you have personally dumped from physical discs you own.
- Modifying and contributing to the source code via pull requests or forks, in line with the project's collaborative goals.

You may not use GCRecomp for commercial exploitation, piracy, or any activity that infringes third-party rights (e.g., Nintendo's copyrights).

## 2. Restrictions on Use

  - Access, process, or distribute any copyrighted GameCube games, ROMs, ISOs, or DOL files that you do not legally own and have personally dumped.
  - Distribute recompiled binaries or derivative works without explicit permission from the copyright holders (e.g., Nintendo).
  - Circumvent digital protections, facilitate mass piracy, or engage in any illegal activity.
  - Incorporate Nintendo proprietary code, SDKs, leaked materials, or copyrighted assets.
- **Collaboration-Friendly Terms**: Nothing in this EULA restricts forking the repository, submitting pull requests, or collaborating on the code under CC0. Contributors are encouraged to improve the tool while adhering to clean-room reverse engineering principles.

## 3. Intellectual Property Ownership
- All rights to GCRecomp's source code are dedicated to the public domain under CC0-1.0.
- You retain ownership of any modifications or contributions you make, but by contributing (e.g., via pull request), you agree to dedicate them to the public domain under CC0 and indemnify the Licensor as outlined below.
- Recompiled outputs from GCRecomp may constitute derivative works of third-party copyrights (e.g., Nintendo games) and are your sole responsibility.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranties
GCRecomp is provided "AS IS" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or accuracy. The Licensor does not guarantee that GCRecomp will work with all GameCube titles or produce error-free results.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the Licensor, authors, or contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including loss of data, profits, or business interruption) arising from your use of GCRecomp, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 6. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor, authors, contributors, and any affiliated parties from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from:
- Your misuse of GCRecomp, including any copyright infringement or illegal activities.
- Any recompiled binaries or derivatives you create or distribute.
- Your failure to comply with applicable laws (e.g., copyright laws, DMCA).

Contributors agree to the same indemnification for their contributions.

## 7. Termination
This EULA terminates automatically if you breach any term. Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies of GCRecomp. The Licensor may also terminate this EULA at any time.

## 8. Governing Law
This EULA shall be governed by the laws of South Africa and Germany (European Union), without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of South Africa or Germany, at the Licensor's discretion, or through alternative dispute resolution as mutually agreed.

## 9. Miscellaneous
- **Severability**: If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in effect.
- **Amendments**: The Licensor may update this EULA; continued use constitutes acceptance.
- **No Legal Advice**: This EULA is not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for your specific situation.
