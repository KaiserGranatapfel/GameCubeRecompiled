# GameCubeRecompiled
GCRecomp is an experimental project to statically recompile GameCube games into Rust, producing standalone executables (game.exe) that run natively on modern PCs. Inspired by N64Recomp, it translates GameCube PowerPC binaries (DOL files) into Rust code, paired with a minimal runtime to emulate basic hardware functionality.
